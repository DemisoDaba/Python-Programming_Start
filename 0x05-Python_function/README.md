**Step-1:**

Begin by using the def keyword to define the function
Inside the parentheses after the function name, 
specify the parameters the function expects. 
In this case, we need two parameters: a and b, 
representing the numbers to be added.

**Step-2:**

After the colon :, 
indent the code block that makes up the body of the function. 
This is where you'll write the instructions 
for adding the numbers.

Congrats! You have successfully defined the function. 
You can now use it in your code. 
To call the function and retrieve the result, 
use its name followed by parentheses, passing the required arguments.
